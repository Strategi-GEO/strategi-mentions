# Strategi Mentions demo

Strategi Mentions is Strategi's internal PR operations platform: our team runs client
media outreach through it end to end. Clients never log in; they receive
placements and reports. This file is the exact demo script plus a fresh-clone
setup that gets you from `git clone` to a running demo in under five minutes.

The seed builds a two-client story:

- **Kadai and Co** (F&B): the flagship, mid-flight. A rich media database, an
  active campaign with a pitch in every status, a monitor feed with a request
  due today, and six months of reporting with a clear AI-mentions uplift.
- **Verandah Stays** (hospitality): earlier-stage, for contrast. A campaign still
  being pitched with nothing sent yet, a warming sending domain, two fresh
  monitor requests, and three months of modest early metrics.

## Setup from a fresh clone

Prerequisites: Node 20+, the Supabase CLI, and a container runtime for local
Supabase (Docker Desktop, OrbStack, or colima).

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Start local Supabase (applies every migration in supabase/migrations)
supabase start

# 3. Point the app at it
cp .env.example .env.local
#    Fill these three from the `supabase start` output (or `supabase status`):
#      NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL        -> API URL      (http://127.0.0.1:54321)
#      NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY   -> anon key
#      SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY       -> service_role key
#    Leave everything else as shipped. The three live modules (scraper, AI,
#    DataForSEO) are wired real and simply read seeded data with no keys set;
#    the four mocked modules return realistic sandbox data.

# 4. Seed the demo (deterministic; safe to re-run any time)
npm run seed:demo

# 5. Run it
npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:3000>. It lands on the Dashboard with **Kadai and Co**
active (the client switcher is top-left).

**Reset between demos:** `npm run seed:demo` wipes and reseeds deterministically,
so the story is identical on every run.

## The three-minute click path

Start on the Dashboard, Kadai and Co active.

**1. Dashboard — the operator's morning (0:00)**
- "One screen for what needs attention today, across every client."
- Two queues: **Needs a response** (reactive monitor requests) and **Awaiting
  approval** (pitches a human must sign off). The Sandbox tag marks data that is
  mocked today.
- Point out the request due today, then move on.

**2. Media Database — the asset we build, not buy (0:25)**
- Go to **Media Database**. "India-first, built in-house: 50 journalists across
  five publications, organised by vertical."
- Filter by vertical or email status. Click a journalist to open the profile
  drawer: beat, receptivity signals (quotes founders, uses data studies), the
  verified email, and their recent articles.
- The **Sandbox** tag on email status: verification is mocked today and goes
  live with one key.
- Switch to the **Publications** tab: each publication shows its last ingestion
  state (complete, complete with skips, and one failed refresh).

**3. Campaign Workspace — the approval flow (0:55)**
- Go to **Campaigns**, open **Monsoon Menu Launch** (active).
- Header shows the story angle and the quarterly data study that hooks
  journalists. The Sandbox tag marks the mocked sending platform.
- **Approvals** tab: the review queue. Keyboard flow is `j`/`k` to move, `e` to
  edit, `a` to approve. Approve one pitch (optimistic, with an undo toast), then
  point at **Push approved** which hands off to the sending platform.
- **Board** tab: the whole pipeline at a glance, a pitch in every status from
  drafted through placed. "The app drafts and matches; a human approves every
  pitch before it sends."

**4. Monitor — the reactive layer (1:45)**
- Go to **Monitor**. Requests grouped by arrival day, **Today** at the top.
- The top request is **due today** with an urgent countdown. Open it: a response
  is already drafted in the client's voice, ready for review and same-day send.
- The **Sandbox** tag: expert-request feeds are mocked today.

**5. Reports — the monthly deliverable (2:15)**
- Go to **Reports**. The AI-mentions figure counts up to its current value with a
  clear month-over-month uplift, a per-engine breakdown, backlinks and referring
  domains, and the coverage log.
- Switch the client (top-left) to **Verandah Stays** to show the contrast: an
  earlier-stage client with smaller, three-month numbers.
- Hit **Export** to open the client-ready report document (opens in a new tab,
  print or save as PDF). The Sandbox tag notes metrics are sandbox until the
  DataForSEO keys are set.

**6. Settings, Integrations — the purchase checklist (2:50)**
- Go to **Settings, Integrations**. "This is the whole external-service bill."
- Three **Live** integrations run on subscriptions we already hold (Firecrawl,
  Anthropic and Voyage, DataForSEO). Four **Sandbox** integrations each read
  "Activates with API key."
- Close with the line: "Each Sandbox row is one API key to go live. Nothing else
  in the app changes."

## What is live vs sandbox

Every external service is reached only through `/lib/providers`, each with a mock
and a real implementation selected per `*_PROVIDER` env var. The Integrations
screen (`/settings/integrations`) is the source of truth.

| Service | MVP mode | Vendor |
|---|---|---|
| Scraper | Live | Firecrawl |
| AI models | Live | Anthropic + Voyage |
| Link and AI-mention data | Live | DataForSEO |
| Email verification | Sandbox | ZeroBounce / NeverBounce class |
| Sending platform | Sandbox | Smartlead / Instantly |
| Expert-request feeds | Sandbox | Qwoted / Featured |
| Domain health | Sandbox | Sending platform |

The demo runs entirely on seeded data, so no external keys are needed to walk the
path above. Adding a live key (for example `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) lets that module
run for real; adding the DataForSEO login flips the report from Sandbox to live
metrics on the next snapshot.

**Fully interactive offline playground (optional):** set every `*_PROVIDER=mock`
in `.env.local`. Then every action button works without any external key: adding
a publication ingests mock journalists, the match and draft actions return mock
output instantly, and snapshots use mock metrics.

## Troubleshooting

- **`supabase start` fails: port already allocated.** Another Supabase project is
  running on the default ports. Stop it (`supabase stop --project-id <name>`), or
  give this project its own ports in `supabase/config.toml` and update
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` to match.
- **A container fails its health check on colima** (for example `vector` or
  `storage` cannot mount the docker socket). These services are not needed for the
  demo: set `enabled = false` under `[analytics]` and `[storage]` in
  `supabase/config.toml`, then `supabase start` again. Docker Desktop and OrbStack
  do not need this.
- **The app cannot reach the database.** Confirm the three Supabase values in
  `.env.local` match `supabase status`, then restart `npm run dev`.
- **Numbers or data look stale.** Re-run `npm run seed:demo`; it wipes and
  reseeds deterministically.
