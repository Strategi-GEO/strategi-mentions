-- Strategi Mentions :: matching RPC
-- Ranks journalists against a story-angle embedding using pgvector cosine
-- similarity, blending the journalist profile embedding with their single best
-- recent article embedding (docs/data-model.md "Matching").
--
-- Callers embed the story angle via the llm provider, then call this RPC. The
-- /lib/matching layer owns the choice between this embedding path and the
-- keyword fallback; this function is only the embedding path.
--
-- SECURITY INVOKER (default): RLS applies as the calling role, so an
-- authenticated operator only matches over rows their policy permits.
--
-- Score = profile_weight * profile_similarity
--       + (1 - profile_weight) * best_article_similarity
-- where similarity = 1 - cosine_distance. When a journalist has no embedded
-- articles, their profile similarity stands in for the article term so they are
-- still ranked rather than dropped.
